# calculator

A new Flutter project.

Flutter calculator with inspired layout from infinix hot 6x

It was built to perform arithmetic operation using bodmas by using only for loops 
And a whole bunch of if statement


You may have noticed the trycatch widget which is not being used 

Trycatch is just another calculator which I developed that doesn't care about bodmas and only accepts 2 variable

Breakthrough widget contains the main content of the calculator.. It contains the function that does the manipulating
.It takes more than 2 variables unlike the trycatch widget.. Enjoy and be free to contribute if you see a better way of performing the operation with for loop and if statements
